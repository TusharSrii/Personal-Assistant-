#Hardware and Software Requirement :

Visual Studio Code or any  Python Interpreter is required to run the JARVIS code provided we need to install several Python libraries  before execution of the code:-

pyttsx: (Offline Text to Speech Service) - pip install pyttsx3

As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in various search engines like Google, Bing or Yahoo, searching for videos, retrieving images, live weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details, health recommendations based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user statements/commands are analysed with the help of machine learning to give an optimal solution.
